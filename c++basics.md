if-else statements are like the Swiss Army knife of decision-making. They offer flexibility and can handle a wide range of conditions and branching logic. You can use them when you need to evaluate complex conditions or when conditions aren't based on simple equality checks. If-else statements are often the preferred choice for scenarios where the conditions are not easily enumerable or where you need to execute different blocks of code based on various conditions.
On the other hand, switch statements shine when you have a single variable to compare against multiple distinct values. They are concise, making the code cleaner and more structured. So, if-else statements and switch statements can complement each other, with if-else statements handling complex conditions and switch statements simplifying cases with multiple exact matches.

The ‘Switch’ Statement
Key Considerations for Switch Case Statements:

Requirement for a Constant Expression
A switch statement necessitates that its expression results in a constant value. This can include constants and arithmetic operations.
Limited to Integer or Character Types
Switch statements are exclusively designed to handle integer or character values. Ensure that the expression provides values of type int or char.
Significance of the 'Break' Keyword
The 'break' keyword holds significant importance within switch cases. It serves as an exit mechanism from the switch statement. Its omission implies the execution of all subsequent cases.
Optional Default Case
Optionally, you can include a 'default' case, which executes when none of the case values match. It's not obligatory and can be excluded if not needed.
Prohibition of Duplicate Case Values
Within a switch statement in C++, duplicates of case values are disallowed. Each case value must be distinct.
Potential for Nested Switch Statements
While it's possible to nest one switch statement inside another in C++, this practice is generally discouraged due to its potential to introduce complexity and hinder code readability.

What is a For Loop and Why is it Used?

A for loop is a control structure in programming that allows you to execute a specific block of code repeatedly. It's especially useful when you want to perform the same task multiple times without duplicating your code. Let's break down the essential components of a for loop:

Initialization: You declare and initialize a variable that serves as a counter. This step only happens once at the beginning.
Condition: You specify a condition that determines when the loop should stop executing.
Increment/Decrement: You define how the counter variable changes after each iteration.

WHILE LOOP 
In the world of computer programming, loops are invaluable tools that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. One such loop is the "while" loop.

A while loop follows a simple sequence of steps:

Evaluation of Test Expression: The loop begins by evaluating a test expression.
Condition Check: If the test expression is true, the code inside the loop's body is executed.
Re-evaluation: After executing the code, the test expression is evaluated again.
Continuation or Termination: This process continues until the test expression becomes false, at which point the while loop terminates.

Syntax

while (condition) {
    // body of the loop
}
